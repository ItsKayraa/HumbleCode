# HumbleCode
HumbleCode is a simplified version of Assembly that's a compiler. It gets compiled to Assembly and eventually asks you to if you have nasm installed or not and you want to transform the Assembly code to .bin file which is bootable. The programming language is amde for making OS Development way easier.

## What Can Humble Code Do?
Humble Code can compile simple and easy .hc files to Assembly files. It's generally made for making bootloader or any other things and it's not goaled to make very advanced programs but you can still make these advanced programs using asm and endasm functions. 

This Programming language has very easy to understand syntax where most of the people can code this. It can be even used for OS Education since it gives the Assembly version of a Humble Code code. It has a local variable system which is not handled inside the Assembly Code.

WARNING!

This compiler is not done yet. This isn't the full ersion or the best version. Please give me comments on how could I improve things!
